# hs-checkers

A network framework for staging games of checkers against human or AI players.

### Wish List
* Registering games history in some crude database (you can't do machine learning without data to learn from)
* Make the plumbing orthogonal to the game played, so that you can plug-and-play different 2 players turn-based game
